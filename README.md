The ***VERONA*** library is a powerful Python tool designed to evaluate and compare predictive process
monitoring models *fairly and under equal conditions*. Leveraging the benchmark published in Rama-Maneiro et al. [1],
this library provides comprehensive functions for assessing the performance of predictive models in the context of 
business process monitoring.

## Key Features
- **Benchmark-Based Metrics:** Utilize established benchmarks from the aforementioned paper to evaluate your 
predictive models, ensuring *fair and standardized comparisons*.
- **Model Comparison:** Easily compare different predictive process monitoring models using a variety of metrics 
tailored to business process contexts.
- **Dataset Splitting:** Implement efficient dataset splitting techniques, including hold-out and cross-validation 
schemes, to facilitate rigorous testing and validation of your models.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive functions and clear documentation make it easy for users to integrate the 
library into their projects and research workflows.

## Instalation
You can install the library from this repository as follows:
- Create a virtual environment (preferably a Conda environment):
```bash
conda create -n verona_env python==3.11
```
- Initialize the environment:
```bash
conda activate verona_env
```
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Install the code as library:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

Or you can just install it using pip:
```bash
